  Late. Sri. Pendekanti Venkata SubbaiahFormer Union Minister of State for Home & Parliamentary Affairs and Former Governor of Bihar and Karnataka




Sri Pendekanti Venkatasubbaiah, one of the veteran statesmen of Independent India,
  held many important positions in his lifetime. He served in the capacities of the
  Union Minister of State for Home & Parliamentary Affairs (1980-84), the Governor
  of Bihar, and later, of Karnataka.
 

  Sri Pendekanti Venkatasubbaiah was born in an affluent family of agriculturists
  on 18th June, 1921 at Sanjamala, a village in the erstwhile Princely State of Banaganapalli
  in Kurnool District of Andhra Pradesh. He took keen interest in the national movement
  while he was a student in Nandyal, the constituency he represented subsequently
  for 27 years in Lok Sabha. He dedicated himself to the national movement and fought
  against oppression and even, braving imprisonment.
 


  Sri Venkatasubbaiah was secular in his outlook throughout his life and fought firmly
  against all kinds of inequalities and oppression. His vision for an egalitarian
  and progressive future reflects in the institutions that he founded and inspired.
 

  A Gandhian to the core, he had a passionate interest in Education, Khadi and Co-operation.
  He started several educational institutions, hostels for poor boys and Co-operative
  Societies.
 

  Vasavi College of Engineering was established in 1981 by Vasavi Academy of Education under the stewardship
  of 
  Late Sri Pendekanti Venkata Subbaiah, a veteran statesman of
  independent India and by a few eminent people from different walks of life.
  
  The College of Engineering represents a rich tradition of excellence in
  technology based education in a stimulating environment.

Embedded Systems & VLSI Design [ECE][ME]


 The present day gadgets of today call for systems, which are self-sustained and self-adjustable for meeting different conditions.
 This calls for processors to be integrated into the products. These are called Embedded Systems. The complex
 circuits are realized using VLSI. Therefore, the course on Embedded Systems & VLSI is appropriate to meet the
 present day needs of the electronic industry. This program has two parts. Part I deals with the requirements of VLSI
 for Embedded Systems, and Part II deals with realization of these VLSI circuits.
 
Faculty

 The department has well-qualified and experienced faculty in the relevant areas of Embedded Systems, Computers,
 Microelectronics and VLSI. Out of the 32 faculty members of the department, nearly 10 of them are actively
 associated with this P.G. Program.
 
Placement

 To carry out this program effectively, the department collaborates with relevant industries and interacts with
 GAETEC. This arrangement enables us to undertake meaningful projects and places students in relevant sectors.
 
Facilities

 The VLSI Design lab was established almost two years ago, and has 20 Compaq P IV systems along with EDA tools from
 Mentor Graphics. In due course, 5 licenses of Synopsis tools will be added.

Communication Engineering & Signal Processing [ECE][ME]


 Traditionally, though "Signal Processing‟ is dealt in analog domain, with the advent of high speed computers, the
 focus has shifted to digital domain, Therefore "Digital Signal Processing‟ has attained prominence. Digital Signal
 Processing finds applications in almost every conceivable field of engineering. Its impact on consumer electronics
 is evidenced by the proliferation of digital communication, digital audio, digital television and digital imaging.
 

 The 3G communication systems employ technologies supported by transmission and channel- assignment techniques such
 as TDMA, CDMA and OFDM. Also, there is a need to develop novel signal transmission techniques. It is important to
 obtain maximal benefit from the various transmission techniques using the diversity techniques along with mitigating
 the impairments of the wireless channel. Therefore, advanced receiver signal processing techniques are also of
 interest.
 

 Wireless communication operations permit services, such as long range communications, without the use of wires. The
 term "wireless" has become a generic and all-encompassing word used to describe communications in which
 electromagnetic waves or RF carry a signal over part or the entire communication path, for example Mobile
 Communication.
 

 Professional Land Mobile Radio and Specialized Mobile Radio typically used by business, industrial and Public
  Safety entities. 
 Consumer and professional Marine VHF radios. 
 Cellular telephones and pagers that provide connectivity for portable and mobile applications, both personal
  and business. 
 Global Positioning System (GPS): allows drivers of cars and trucks, captains of boats and ships, and pilots of
  aircraft to ascertain their location anywhere on earth. 
 Cordless computer peripherals: The cordless mouse is a common example; 
 Keyboards and printers can also be linked to a computer via wireless. 
 Cordless telephone sets: These are limited-range devices, not to be confused with cell phones. 
 Satellite television: It allows viewers in almost any location to select from hundreds of channels. 


 Today, there are many service providers in the wireless communication industry to cater to the increasing demand for
 these services. This necessitates availability of trained and skilled manpower in this area. Therefore, starting a
 postgraduate course in Signal Processing and Communication Systems will be an appropriate choice in ECE department.
 The course aims at training the students in development and deployment of various signal processing related
 techniques in the latest communication systems.

Acumen 


 The pace of progress in the field of Science & Technology in this millennium has overshadowed the speed of Technological changes in the past decades. In this millennium, this pace would intensify and may even reach a state beyond our imagination. Technical Symposiums like Acumen are an effort to catch up with the pace of technological innovation.
 

 Acumen triggered off in the year 1996. It was the first of its kind in Hyderabad and had an overwhelming response. It paved way to Acumen '99, which was a great success, too. Around 180 papers from various parts of the country were received and students from various universities and institutes like IIT, NIT etc. have participated in this symposium.
 

 ACUMEN is a one-day festival. The event seeks to achieve communication of innovative ideas that promote the cause of the technological advantage among the students, and also keep them abreast with the latest advances in their respective fields. It also opens a window to the participants to interact with people from different backgrounds and upgrade their knowledge.
 

 The theme "YOUTH-TECHNOLOGY-FUTURE" asserts the fact that the future of technology lies in the hands of the youth.
 

 This is the time for the students to explore & exhibit their talents in the areas related to academic routine. The events conducted during this festival are Technical Grand Prix, Poster Presentation, Rocketry, LAN Party, Constructors Championship, Technocraftz and spot events like Techno Witz, MineSweeper, Puzzle 'O' Mania, and PotPouri.

Extra-curricular Activities 


 The educational experience at Vasavi College of Engineering is enlivened and enriched by an array of extra-curricular activities that fulfill the social, emotional, cultural and creative needs of its students.
 

 Euphoria, a gala event that marks the annual sports, literary and cultural fete, is an exciting occasion for fun-filled moments.
 

 Acumen is an annual national symposium on technology that brings together the budding engineers onto a common platform.
 

 'Reflections' is the annual alumni meet conducted by the College Alumni Association and serves as a forum for a mutually useful interaction between the ex-students and the present students. Technocrats is the college magazine that lets the students give vent to their creative and scholastic skills.
 

 In addition, student clubs like Speak Easy (Public Speaking), Kirdar (Dramatics) and Flamencos (Music Club) along with the student 
 chapters of IEEE, ISTE, ACM and CSI liven up the life on the campus, round the year. The spacious grounds of the college are always 
 abuzz with sports activities. Our students have consistently won laurels for the college in various games at University and National Levels.

KRITI 


 According to ancient lore, it is due to creation, or KRITI that our whole world came into being. It is because of KRITI that the
 wonders around the world exist! Truly KRITI is the basis of the universe!!!

 
 
 Vasavians strongly believe in power of creation and it is to prove this point that KRITI an annual art exhibition came into being.
 Over the past two years KRITI has given students a platform on which to showcase their powers of creativity through the mass cultural
 medium of art. It also provides vasavians and the fineart students an opportunity to hone their latest skills through interaction with famous
 artists from all over the country.
 

 A resounding success since its first year, KRITI has always amazed and inspired the admiring public with the immense talent creativity of students,
 who present their ideas in the form of paintings, murals, photographs and sculptures.


 The inspired works appeared in various hues, shapes and formats from sketches in pencil and charcoal to regular paper and canvas. 
 The participation of the Eminent Artists and the Budding Artists from the various Fine Art Colleges of the Twin Cities turned KRITI
 into a great success than before with more paintings, more sculptures, more people and in general more art! The proceeds of this valuable 
 Art work will be donated for Child Heart Surgery as a philanthropic gesture.

National Service Scheme (NSS)


    The National Service Scheme (NSS) is an Indian government-sponsored public service program conducted by the Ministry of Youth
    Affairs
    and Sports of the Government of India. Popularly known as NSS, the scheme was launched in Gandhiji's Centenary year in 1969.
    Aimed at developing student's personality through community service, NSS is a voluntary association of young people in Colleges,
    Universities and at +2 level working for a campus-community (esp. Villages) linkage.

   

    The NSS Unit of VCE is organizing a 7-day SPECIAL CAMP at Ibrahimbhagh village. By engaging students in developing solutions
    for the    problems stated below.
   

 Dry and wet waste management.
 Mosquito menace.
 Improving learning outcomes in Govt Schools
 Water supply to 250 Household.
 Blood Donation Camp and Medical Camp.


    Our Activities:



   

Special Camp
 Blood Donation
 Plantation
 Immunisation
 Shramdaan
 Disaster Management



    The symbol for the NSS is based on the giant Rath Wheel of the world-famous Konark Sun Temple (The Black Pagoda)
    situated in Odisha, India. The wheel portrays the cycle of creation, preservation and release. It signifies the movement
    in life across time and space. The symbol thus stands for continuity as well as change and implies the continuous striving
    of NSS for a positive social change. The eight bars in the wheel represent 24 hours of a day. The red colour indicates that the
    volunteer is full of young blood that is lively, active, energetic and full of high spirit. The navy blue colour indicates
    the cosmos of which the NSS is a tiny part, ready to contribute its share for the welfare of the mankind.
    It stands for continuity as well as change and implies the continuous striving of NSS for social transformation and uplift.
   
 The Motto of NSS "Not Me But You", reflects the essence of democratic living and upholds the need for 
   self-less service

STREET CAUSE

    The motto of street cause is “A life without a Cause is a life without effect”
   

    Street Cause is a Non-Government Organization (NGO) which has been started by a group of students. The aim of this organization
    is to give a new lease of life to street children, elderly people and incapacitated beggars by admitting them into orphanages 
    and old age homes and also by teaching those means to earn their living.
   

    Street Cause Vasavi unit was started in 2012 as a division undertaking the causes of the underprivileged sections of the society.
    Our Institution is actively participating in Street Cause activities of Hyderabad and won the Best Division award consecutively
    for three years from 2015-16, 2016-17 and 2018-19.

Home / Traditional day
Traditional day 


 As a pre-Euphoria event, Traditional day, the first of its kind in the history of Vasavi, was introduced last year. This year it was celebrated
 on February 18th and the response was simply amazing with nearly 90% of the students and the staff turning up in traditional attires, representing 
 different cultures. It was a welcome change for all the Vasavians, who looked wonderful in the colourful sarees, sherwanis, kurtas, etc.

 
 
 The day started with Ganesh Pooja, performed by our honourable principal. The Pooja was attended by all the staff members and the students of the
 college. After the Pooja, there were a lot of traditional events like the mehendi competition and the rangoli for the girls and kite flying
 and matka phod for the boys. These events were conducted by the final year students.

 


 The highlight event of the day was the "Dandiya" where the students danced to the famous dandiya tracks being played by a student of our college. 
 In all, it was a great success and it definitely strengthened the bonds among the Vasavians.

Green Practices

    Students and staff are encouraged to use Bicycles and public transport. The Institution provides good transportation facilities for the staff and students alike.
   
Pedestrian Friendly Roads

    The entire campus is well laid out with black-top roads and pavements for pedestrian use.
   
Plastic free campus

    Awareness is being created amongst the staff and the students to reduce the use of plastic. "Say No to Plastic" sign boards have been displayed at prominent places of the campus.
   

Paperless office

    To minimize the usage of paper, all circulars for staff are placed in the intranet.
   

    Course plans, lesson plans and academic schedules are sent to the students through group email.
   

    Students are encouraged to use both sides of papers for record work.
   

    Double-sided printing option is being used at all terminals with access to printers. Eco friendly initiative of using one side printed papers is encouraged. One side printed papers are used by staff for rough work.

   

    Green landscaping with trees and plants

   

    The Institution has a sprawling 12.7 acre campus with lush green lawns beautifully landscaped. The green ambience of the Institution is largely due to tree plantation which maintains the ecosystem.
   


    Every year tree plantation programs are taken up to increase the green cover on campus. Saplings are planted to encourage eco-concern among the students.
   

Save Power

    Conserving electricity is the need of the hour.
    Students and staff are instructed to save power to the possible extent.
    Many sign boards to “save power” are displayed in all key areas of the campus.

   


    Energy efficient electronic gadgets are used in the campus to conserve energy. All classrooms are installed with 3600 PIR (Passive Infra-Red) motion sensors which are used to control the fans and lights depending upon the presence/absence of people in the room. This is done with a view to conserve electricity which is the need of the hour.
   









    As part of Green Campus Initiative, Vasavi College of Engineering has initially commissioned 200kWp rooftop grid tied fixed tilt solar power plant in the campus in the year 2014. The rooftop solar PV plant was erected on J.C.Bose block and Viswesrayya block. A 41.53 Sq.mt area is available on J.C.Bose block on which 125 Kwp SPV Installed and a 25 Sq.mt area is available on Viswesrayya block on which 75 Kwp SPV installed.
   

Save Water

    Water conservation has become the need of the hour. To this end 24 rainwater harvesting pits have been dug in strategic places to collect the rainwater. The rain water is channelized properly to recharge the ground water level thereby reducing the dependence on water supplied by municipality
   


    Students and staff are encouraged to minimize the wastage of water. For this purpose a display boards are placed at prominent places
   


    Liquid waste generated by the Institution is treated by a Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) has a capacity of 50,000 litres. The treated water is used for gardening purposes. This saves potable groundwater and supply of plant treated water by government agency.

Language Laboratories

 The Language Laboratories were established in 1999 to complement the classroom learning of the students by imparting communication and interpersonal skills. The Phonetics Laboratory trains students in using and comprehending the nuances of English speech, to minimize mother tongue influence, and eventually improve their pronunciation.
 

 In today's global village, it is difficult not to see the relevance of this skill. The course content in phonetics contains graded aural exercises in 
 pronunciation, stress and accent in the order of word, sentence, and discourse levels. The course is so designed that students, especially those
 who come
  from vernacular medium and have little exposure to conversing in English, can proceed to learn it at their own pace and on their own, with minimum
  assistance from the instructor.
 


01Phonetics lab 


  The phonetics lab has 34 systems with language software in the domains of pronunciation, connected speech and business English. The objective of the phonetics lab is to train students and fine tune their pronunciation. Since English is our second language, we tend to carry some of the features of the mother tongue into English. Hence, the computer aided language software will help them immensely. After the inputs are given by the teacher, students practice speech sounds and patterns. Regular practice in the lab helps them overcome many of the drawbacks they encounter while speaking. Thus, students can improve their pronunciation considerably. The aim is to teach students the neutralized accent so as to match and understand their foreign counterparts in business and corporate settings while communicating with them on inter-related projects.
  
The following language software are used in the phonetics lab:

Sky Pronunciation
Connected Speech
Presentations
Telephoning
Meetings 
Negotiating

The above software are aimed at helping the communication skills of the students.


02Interactive Communication Skills' Lab


  The Interactive Communication Skills' Laboratory, equipped with ultramodern audio-visual
  tools and a congenial space, orients the students towards an active application
  of their aural-oral skills through creative activities.
  

  The activities range from as basic interactive situation as in informal introduction,
  to formal presentations. They include other activities like group discussions, debates,
  elocutions and simulations. Personality development has been an important component
  in the objectives of these activities. Vibrant to the needs of a heterogeneous student
  community with varied socio-economic backgrounds, the department allows for a new
  beginning of learning of the language by the previously less privileged among them,
  so that the differences between their standards can be bridged as much as possible.
  

  The interactive communication skills lab helps students improve their skills
  in public speaking, debates, group discussions, and role plays. These activities
  involve a lot of team work and, students can enhance their communication skills
  effectively. The sessions inculcate in them the need to be expressive and
  appropriate in real life situations Behavior and attitude and people skills too
  are instilled through these activities. Confidence, self-esteem and assertiveness
  which are the prerequisites for an engineering professional are reinforced time
  and again through well–defined activities. Presentation skills are another requirement
  of the corporate sector where our students will eventually find their foothold, and
  so this skill is taught very effectively in the interactive communication skills lab.

   Counselling Cell, with Principal as Chairman, Director (Student Welfare), HoDs as members, has been constituted by the Management.

Home / Facilities / Safety Measures / Earthing
Earthing 

 Earthing eliminates the possibility of any dangerous potential rise on the body of an electrical equipment.The meaning of earthling or grounding is to connect earth point of equipment to the general mass of earth by wire of negligible resistance. This brings the body of electrical equipment to zero potential and thus will avoid the shock to the human being. The number of
 Earth pits increased from 54 to 62 across the campus.

Placements & Training Cell

 
   Vasavi College of Engineering places special emphasis on experiential learning in its training process. In this regard, the College 
   has adopted pedagogical practices in collaboration with industry, businesses, counterpart institutions and international experience to provide
   enhanced learning opportunities to the students.

   Practical skills in the chosen discipline apart, overall personality development assumes an essential aspect of every course of study. 
   This is precisely the reason why the College has chosen to invest significant resources in setting up such auxiliary facilities as
   Phonetics & Interactive Communication Skills Labs.
   

   The Training & Placement Cell at Vasavi College of Engineering provides personal and career-oriented support to its students. The main motive is to enable the students to effectively cope with academics at college and also for successful careers after graduating from the college. Apart from the training provided during the regular course curriculum, the college also provides an extensive training program of about 100 hours during the vacation period after the pre-final year exams to prepare the students for the recruitment process in their final year. The college engages specialized trainers for conducting this training. The effectiveness of the training is evident from the consistent and remarkable placement record.
   

   A large number of students have been getting admission into prestigious institutions in India and overseas, for higher studies.
   The college has been a frontrunner in campus recruitments in the state with many major companies, both from the IT and Core sector,
   visiting the college year-on-year for recruiting the young talent from the college. The companies that visit the campus include Microsoft,
   Oracle, Pega Systems, S&P Capital IQ, Deloitte, Factset, NetCracker, ADP, Infosys, Cognizant, Accenture, Wipro, Mahindra Rise, Tata 
   Advanced Systems Limited (TASL), L&T Constructions, Intergraph, Infotech Enterprises Limited (now Cyient), CSC, CapGemini, iGate,

Training

   To prepare the students for placements every year, pre-placement training (CRT) is organised in the summer break for 3rd year students,
   just before 4th year 1st semester. A highly structured 100 hours training will be imparted every year on soft skills. Topics such 
   as Quantitative Ability, Verbal Ability, Logical Reasoning, essay writing, resume preparation mock interviews will be covered.
   

   Quality training sessions are also conducted to gear up the students for group discussions on various topics.
   

   This program enables the students to acquire sufficient knowledge to qualify in aptitude written tests of various companies
   that will be visiting the campus during their 4th year 1st semester.
   

   Guest lectures and special invitee lecture series are organized for all the branches of students from industry experts.
   

   These trainings are aimed at improving the placement percentage year on year.

   
Evidence of Success:

   Placement Summaries for the last 5 years indicate that the students have been performing consistently well and are recruited by
   reputed companies and the average pay package has been increasing every year. The details are as follows:
